# html-tutorial-practice

This is a practice project I built by following the [HTML Course by Dave Gray (gitdagray)](https://github.com/gitdagray/html_course), specifically [Lesson 10](https://github.com/gitdagray/html_course/tree/main/10_lesson).

## ðŸ”§ Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn and practice foundational HTML concepts by building a structured web page.

I followed along with the tutorial step-by-step to understand:
- Semantic HTML elements
- Page layout structure (headers, footers, main content, etc.)
- Navigation menus
- Sectioning content
- Best practices for writing clean and readable HTML

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- Proper use of `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, and other semantic tags
- How to structure a simple website using HTML only
- Clean indentation and formatting
- How to plan and organize HTML content before styling with CSS
